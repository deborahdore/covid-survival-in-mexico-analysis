Our project aims to develop a model using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to accurately predict patients who are likely to die. The model has shown excellent performance with an accuracy of 97%, precision of 96% and recall of 99%. This could aid in providing timely treatments, improve hospital capabilities and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare professionals.
